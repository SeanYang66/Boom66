This is one of the games created by Sean Yang as part of the learning experience in Unity Engine with C# scripting
The purpose of the project is mostly practicing working with Unity Engine, so game level design is currently limited.

You can access the game currently at http://www.sharemygame.com/share/5fef24fc-8235-47ec-a590-1c9b4c205533
The link is updated every 30 days. Still working on a permanent host
